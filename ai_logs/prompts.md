#First Prompt
Design System Context: "We are building a developer verification platform with the Base (Coinbase L2) design aesthetic.

Global Rules:

Colors: Background is strictly #0A0B0D. Primary Action color is Base Blue (#0052FF).

Shapes: Use rounded-full for buttons and rounded-lg for cards.

Surfaces: Cards are solid #141519. Do NOT use glassmorphism or blurs. Use solid colors.

Typography: Use Inter for everything. Keep headings tracking-tight and bold.

Motifs: Use Circles frequently. The 'Trust Score' should be a white number inside a solid Blue Circle.

Behavior: Interactions should feel 'flat' and 'snappy'. No neon glows. Use lucide-react icons (solid fill where possible)."
